📄 Django Application Requirement Document
🧩 Project Title: Smart Marketing & Sentiment Dashboard
📚 Project Overview
A Django-based platform for:

Authenticated users to upload Excel files containing emails, categories, frequencies, etc., which will be used to send bulk automated marketing emails asynchronously based on defined rules.

Hashtag-based sentiment analysis system that searches hashtags on various social media platforms, performs analysis, and generates detailed visual reports and comparisons over time/platform.

⚙️ Core Functional Features
1. Authentication & User Management
Login, registration, logout (JWT/session-based)

User profile and API key/token management

Admin dashboard (for superuser overview and feature toggles)

2. Excel Upload and Email Automation
Upload .xlsx file via dashboard

File contains: email, category, frequency, and other custom columns

Backend parses data and schedules emails:

Based on frequency (daily, weekly, etc.)

Based on category

Send emails asynchronously using Celery + Redis/Kafka

Track:

How many emails sent

How many succeeded/failed

Open and bounce rate if possible (using mail provider webhooks)

3. Sentiment Analysis Engine
Users can input one or multiple hashtags

Choose platforms to query: (Twitter/X, Instagram, Reddit, YouTube, TikTok) — all as plugins/modules

Use OAuth for token-based authenticated access per platform

Run background search using Celery Beat (scheduled intervals)

Collect recent posts/comments and store for processing

Sentiment Analysis:
Use NLP libraries (like TextBlob, NLTK, or HuggingFace Transformers)

Generate scores: Positive / Negative / Neutral

Assign category: Happy / Sad / Angry / Sarcastic / etc.

Track keyword frequencies and top words

4. Reports and Dashboard
Email Reports:

Emails sent vs. scheduled

Success/Failure stats

Frequency distribution (daily/weekly/monthly)

Charts using Chart.js or Plotly

Sentiment Reports:

Bar, pie, and line charts showing:

Sentiment trends over time

Platform comparison

Before vs. after sentiment for the same hashtag

Top-performing hashtags

Word clouds of common keywords

Export to PDF/CSV

🔌 Plugin/Modular System
Admin can enable/disable social media plugins

Pluggable architecture for platforms:

Twitter Module

Instagram Module

Reddit Module

YouTube Module

OAuth2 integration for each platform

Abstract class/interface for new platform support

🏗️ Tech Stack
Backend:
Django 5.x

Django Rest Framework

PostgreSQL (main DB)

Celery (task queue)

Redis or Kafka (message broker)

Celery Beat (scheduled jobs)

Docker + Docker Compose

Frontend:
Django templates or optionally React (can be decoupled later)

Chart.js / Plotly for charts

HTMX or Alpine.js for dynamic UI if templates are used

NLP:
TextBlob or Transformers (HuggingFace) for sentiment

Optional: Integrate with OpenAI/LLMs for smarter insights

APIs:
OAuth2 for social media APIs (Twitter API v2, Reddit API, etc.)

SMTP or Email Services (Sendgrid, Mailgun, etc.)

Webhooks for bounce/open tracking (optional)

📊 Database Schema (Sample Entities)
User

EmailSchedule: user, email, category, frequency, next_run

SentEmailLog: email_id, status, timestamp

HashtagSearch: hashtag, platforms[], created_by, last_checked

SocialPost: hashtag, platform, content, sentiment_score, timestamp

SentimentReport: hashtag, platform, date_range, scores, trend

⚙️ Asynchronous Task Examples
process_excel_upload(file_id)

send_bulk_emails(schedule_id)

scrape_social_posts(hashtag, platform)

run_sentiment_analysis(post_ids)

generate_sentiment_report(hashtag, timeframe)

🧪 Testing
Unit tests with Pytest or Django test runner

Use factory_boy or Model Mommy for mock data

Mock APIs for external social media integrations

🚀 DevOps
Dockerfile + docker-compose

.env for config (use django-environ)

Postgres volume + Redis

Celery worker and beat in containers

Gunicorn + Nginx for deployment

CI/CD with GitHub Actions

🧠 Future Suggestions
Add AI-powered email content generator (GPT-like)

Personalize email content based on sentiment and interests

Use Grafana/Metabase for external BI visualization
